DESCRIPTION				   *SelectSameVisualBlock-description*

Searching for an exact text block can be handy, but Vim's regular expressions
don't allow to do that (for arbitrary, aligned columns), and search
highlighting would either match only the first line segment, each line
individually, or the surrounding inner text as well, making it difficult to
operate on.

This plugin locates the next match of the selected text, and re-creates the
selection there. It is most useful for |blockwise-visual| selections; for a
characterwise selection, a simpler mapping would do (and several plugins (see
below) already provide this). For |linewise-visual| selections, it doesn't
just search for the exact same line(s) (which also can be done easily via
regular expression search), but allows additional (same-width) prefix text or
(arbitrary) suffix text, sort of turning the linewise selection into a
blockwise one (without insisting on equal line width, though).

SEE ALSO								     *

- SearchHighlighting.vim (vimscript #4320) has a {Visual}* mapping that
  matches the (blockwise) selection, but loses the assertion on vertical
  alignment due to the use of regular expressions.

USAGE						 *SelectSameVisualBlock-usage*
						     *v_[_CTRL-V* *v_]_CTRL-V*

{Visual}[<C-v>		Search for the [count]'th occurrence of the currently
{Visual}]<C-v>		selected text in the same form.
			For linewise selections, that means lines starting or
			ending with the same text, possibly with additional
			suffix / (same-width) prefix text. Note that suffix
			text will be included in the selection, as there's no
			irregular selection within a line, and repeats of the
			same search therefore won't work.
			For blockwise selections, that means each line starts
			at the same screen column (i.e. the left border of the
			selection stays aligned). For a jagged-edge selection
			(|v_$|), only text at the end of lines will match.

INSTALLATION				  *SelectSameVisualBlock-installation*

The code is hosted in a Git repo at
    https://github.com/inkarkat/vim-SelectSameVisualBlock
You can use your favorite plugin manager, or "git clone" into a directory used
for Vim |packages|. Releases are on the "stable" branch, the latest unstable
development snapshot on "master".

This script is also packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip"
decompressor in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise,
decompress the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by
sourcing the vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim SelectSameVisualBlock*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES				  *SelectSameVisualBlock-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Requires the |ingo-library.vim| plugin (vimscript #4433), version 1.036 or
  higher.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION				 *SelectSameVisualBlock-configuration*
						 *SelectSameVisualBlock-remap*
If you want to use different mappings, map your keys to the
<Plug>(SelectSameVisualBlock...) mapping targets _before_ sourcing the script
(e.g. in your |vimrc|): >
    xmap ]<C-v> <Plug>(SelectSameVisualBlockNext)
    xmap [<C-v> <Plug>(SelectSameVisualBlockPrev)
<
